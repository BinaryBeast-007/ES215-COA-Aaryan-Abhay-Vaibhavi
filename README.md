Computer Organization and Architecture (ES215) by Prof. Rajat Moona and Prof. Sameer Kulkarni. \n
We have done the complete implementation of a RISC-V SDLX Processor using Verilog which runs on a BASYS-3 FPGA Board.
The code contains a Top Module along with an ALU and a Register File. We have made it so that all types of functions (R type Triadic, R-I type Triadic and R type Dyadic instructions) can be used in it.
